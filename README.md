### React Password Generator Documentation

### Overview

The React Password Generator is a web application built with React, Vite for efficient development, Tailwind CSS for styling, and is deployed on Vercel. This project showcases the use of React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef) to create a password generator with options to customize password length, include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, it allows users to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
